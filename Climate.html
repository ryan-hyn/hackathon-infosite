        <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
        <h3>Climate change is the long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. It is caused by: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rising Temperatures: Increased heat leads to more frequent and severe heatwaves, affecting human health and increasing energy demands.
            </li>
            <li>Sea Level Rise: Higher sea levels contribute to coastal erosion, increased flooding, and threaten coastal communities and habitats.
            </li>
            <li>Droughts and Flooding: Altered precipitation patterns result in droughts and floods, impacting water resources, agriculture, and infrastructure.

            </li>
            <li>Ecosystem Disruptions: Climate change affects biodiversity, leading to shifts in species distributions and ecosystem functions.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
        <h3>Climate change is the long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. It is caused by: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rising Temperatures: Increased heat leads to more frequent and severe heatwaves, affecting human health and increasing energy demands.
            </li>
            <li>Sea Level Rise: Higher sea levels contribute to coastal erosion, increased flooding, and threaten coastal communities and habitats.
            </li>
            <li>Droughts and Flooding: Altered precipitation patterns result in droughts and floods, impacting water resources, agriculture, and infrastructure.

            </li>
            <li>Ecosystem Disruptions: Climate change affects biodiversity, leading to shifts in species distributions and ecosystem functions.

            </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="column">
        <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
        <h3> Climate change matters because it affects nearly every part of our lives.
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Your future üåé - A hotter planet means more natural disasters, food shortages, and economic struggles.
            </li>
            <li>
                Health risks üè• - More heatwaves and pollution lead to breathing problems, disease outbreaks, and other health issues.
            </li>

            <li>
                Your environment üêª - Wildlife struggles as habitats disappear and oceans become more acidic.
            </li>

            <li>
                Society üåç - Climate change worsens inequality, forcing people to leave their homes due to disasters and food shortages.
            </li>

        <h2>What are things that I can do to help?</h2> 
        
            <p>
                Switch to renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro) instead of fossil fuels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Improve energy efficiency (better insulation, LED lighting, efficient appliances).
            </p>

            <p> Being conscious of waste and reducing your own production ( Reduce, reuse, and recycle to minimize waste)     </p>
            <p>
                Spread awareness and engage in climate activism.

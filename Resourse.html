        <h2>What is Resource Depletion?</h2>
        <h3>Resource Depletion is when resources are used faster than they can be replenished. It is caused by: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Agriculture: The agricultural sector is a major driver of resource depletion, particularly through deforestation, water usage, and the overuse of land.
            </li>
            <li>Consumer Goods: The demand for electronics, clothing, and other consumer goods puts pressure on resources, leading to waste and overconsumption.
            </li>
            <li>Construction: Cement production alone accounting for 8% of global CO2 emissions.
            </li>
            <li>Energy Production: Fossil fuels, used for energy generation, remain a significant source of environmental degradation, driving both resource extraction and greenhouse gas emissions.
            </li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
        <h3> Resource Depletion matters because it affects nearly every part of our lives. Including:
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Environmental Degradation: Overconsumption of natural resources leads to habitat destruction, loss of biodiversity, and ecosystems collapsing, affecting both land and marine environments.
            </li>
            <li>
                Climate Change: Resource depletion, particularly fossil fuel extraction and use, is a major driver of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming and climate change.
            </li>

            <li>
                Water Scarcity: Overuse of water resources, particularly in agriculture and industry, leads to growing water stress, threatening access to clean water for millions of people worldwide.
            </li>

            <li>
                Economic Inequality: The unsustainable use of resources often impacts vulnerable populations the most, exacerbating global inequality and leading to social instability and conflict.
            </li>

        </ol>

    <div class="column full-width"> 
        <h2>What are things that I can do to help?</h2> 
        
            <p>
                Switch to renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro) instead of fossil fuels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reduce meat consumption to significantly decrease the environmental strain caused by the agricultural sector.
            </p>

            <p> Being conscious of waste and reducing your own production ( Reduce, reuse, and recycle to minimize waste)     </p>
            <p>
                Spread awareness and advocate for policy changes.

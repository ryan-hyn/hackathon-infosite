        <h2>Food waste is food that is discarded or not consumed, even though it is still safe to eat.</h2>
        <h3>This matters because...   </h3>
            <p class="big"> In the U.S., about 40% of food is wasted, costing $218 billion annually.
            </p>
            <p> Wasted food releases harmful greenhouse gases when it decomposes in landfills and it contributes to climate change.
            </p>
            <p> Reducing waste by just 15% could feed over 25 million people.

            <p>
                Switch to renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro) instead of fossil fuels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Improve energy efficiency (better insulation, LED lighting, efficient appliances).

            <p> Being conscious of waste and reducing your own production ( Reduce, reuse, and recycle to minimize waste)     </p>

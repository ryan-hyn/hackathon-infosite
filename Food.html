        Food Waste
    </title>

<div class="container">
    <div class="column">
        <h2>Food waste is food that is discarded or not consumed, even though it is still safe to eat.</h2>
        <h3>This matters because...   </h3>
            <p class="big"> In the U.S., about 40% of food is wasted, costing $218 billion annually.
            </p>
            <p>Overproduction: Often, food is produced in excess, leading to unsold goods that eventually get discarded due to spoilage or expiration.
            </p>
            <p>Retail and Consumer Behavior: In supermarkets, products may be discarded due to imperfections (such as bruises or blemishes), and consumers often purchase more than needed, leading to food waste at home.
            </p>    
            <p>Date Labels: Confusion around labels like "sell by" or "use by" can lead to perfectly good food being thrown away prematurely.
            </p>

        <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
        <h3> Food waste matters because it affects nearly every part of our lives. For example,
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Resource Depletion: Wasting food also means wasting the natural resources used to produce it, such as water, energy, and land.
            </li>
            <li>
                Economic Costs: Food waste leads to significant financial losses for consumers, businesses, and governments. Wasting food also means wasting the labor and resources that went into its production, transportation, and storage.
            </li>

            <li>
                Food Insecurity: At the same time, millions of people around the world face food insecurity. Reducing food waste could help alleviate hunger by redirecting surplus food to those in need.
            </li>

            <li>
                Environmental Impact: Food waste contributes to environmental degradation, particularly through the production of methane in landfills.
            </li>

        </ol>

    <div class="column full-width"> 
        <h2>What are things that I can do to help?</h2> 
        
            <p>
                Plan Meals and Shop Smart: Plan meals ahead of time, make shopping lists, and stick to them to avoid overbuying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understand Food Labels: Pay attention to "use by" and "sell by" dates.
            </p>

            <p> Compost: Instead of throwing away food scraps, compost them to return nutrients to the soil and reduce landfill waste.
            </p>
            <p>
                Donate Surplus Food: If you have excess food that you wonâ€™t use, consider donating it to local food banks or community organizations.
